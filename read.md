 Human emotions can be detected using both speech and visual modalities. Facial expressions can be considered as ideal means for detecting the persons' emotions. In our project, the process of emotion detection of the user is done with the help of facial images that are captured through the live webcam feed. Happy, sad, angry, fear, surprised, disgust, and neutral are the seven basic emotions common to humans, and they are identified by the various expressions of the face . In this process, the frontal view of the facial images is utilized so as to detect the mood from the images.
